# Data Grid Challenge â€“ Mosaic

This is the starter code for the _Data Grid Challenge_ from
[Mosaic](https://mosaic.us).

## Getting started
We provide a few quick tips for getting started:
1. This repository is a slimmed down version of a [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
2. You can install dependencies with `yarn`.
3. You can then run the app with `yarn start`.

At that point, please edit the code in `src/` as you see fit. Good luck!
